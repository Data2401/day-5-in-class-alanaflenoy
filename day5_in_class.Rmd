## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r part two}

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
# variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`
fav_1 <- 9
fav_2 <- 27

# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the
# original variable
fav_1 <- sqrt(fav_1)
fav_2 <- sqrt(fav_2)

# Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
# `sum()` function for practice.
raw_sum <- fav_1 + fav_2


# Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 2 decimal places.
# Use the `round()` function.
round_sum <- round(raw_sum, 2)

# Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and 
# `fav_2` variables rounded to 2 decimal places
round_1 <- round(fav_1, 2)
round_2 <- round(fav_2, 2)

# Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values
sum_round <- sum(round_1, round_2)

# Print out both variables and compare. Are they the same?
round_sum
sum_round
